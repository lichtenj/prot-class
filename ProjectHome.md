## Motivation ##
We present a bioinformatics tool designed to examine protein sequences and characterize them based upon user-defined amino acid (AA) composition percentages and user defined AA sequences. In addition for any given protein sequence, the tool allows for the identification of repeated AA sequences, biased AA compositions within a user-defined window, and putative signal peptide and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor addition sequences, which are responsible for extracellular protein secretion and attachment to the plasma membrane, respectively.

## Results ##

This tool was developed for the identification and characterization of plant hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) using protein sequences deduced from the complete genome sequence of _Arabidopsis thaliana_, a flowering plant model organism ([Showalter et al. 2010](http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/153/2/485)). Nonetheless, this tool is general purpose and can be easily applied to other protein sequences from any organism.
